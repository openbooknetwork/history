You review one story's translation into one language, and fix it in place. The dispatch names the story id and the
language code, and may name page ids: then you review those pages and the catalogue strings they show. A dispatch
that says `stale` is an update: skip to Stale below.

Your reader is a secondary school student or an adult who reads this story in their own language and knows no
English. Judge every sentence by what that reader takes from it.

The rules are `node_modules/@openbooknetwork/kitap/writing/README.md` and the file for your language beside it, such
as `ru.md`. Read both in full first. Run every command from the repo root, and run harita as
`./node_modules/.bin/harita`.

## What you look for

- **Meaning.** The translation says what the English says: no clause dropped or added, every cause, time and
  contrast as in the English, every pronoun pointing to one noun, every number and date as in the English.
- **Names.** Each person, place, state and event takes the form the catalogues give it, the same form on every page,
  label and card, and the form your language's rules and schoolbooks use.
- **Language rules.** Every rule of your language's file holds: the form of address, quotes, numbers, dates, ranges,
  capitals and transcription.
- **Register.** The text reads as a schoolbook written in your language: its own word order and idiom, with no
  phrase that copies the shape of the English.

## Steps

1. **Pages.** For each page folder under `content/<story>/pages/`, in folder order, read `text/en.md` and
   `text/<lang>.md` side by side, paragraph by paragraph, and fix what you find in `text/<lang>.md`. Done when you
   have read every page.
2. **Catalogues.** Run `./node_modules/.bin/harita i18n <lang> --story <story>`. Read each catalogue it lists, every
   value beside its English comment, and fix it the same way. Done when you have read every value.
3. **Checks.** Run `node scripts/check-translation.mjs <story> <lang>` and `./node_modules/.bin/harita check <story>`.
   Fix each problem and run them again. Done when both print `ok`.
4. **Report.** One short paragraph: how many pages and strings you changed, the kinds of fault you found most, and
   each English sentence that reads two ways, with its page, for the author to rewrite. You edit translations only.

## Stale

The translator has worked through the list that `./node_modules/.bin/harita i18n <lang> --story <story> --stale`
writes to `.cache/kitap/stale/<story>/<lang>.yaml`. Run it again now: the list names what you review and nothing
beyond it. Under `pages`, a `changed` or `new` block is read beside its English and fixed in the file named, and a
page marked `unstamped` was written whole since the last review, so read it beside its English as step 1 does. A
`removed` block should be gone from the file; delete it when it is still there. A `missing` page is one the
translator left out: translate it as the translator would, then review it. Under `strings`, read each `new`,
`changed` and `unstamped` key beside its English in the file named and fix it. Then run the checks of step 3. Done
when every block and key of the list is read and both checks print `ok`. Report as step 4 does. The stamps are
written by whoever dispatched you, once you report.
